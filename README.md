# DeDNet
The code of "DeDNet: Infrared and visible image fusion with noise removal by decomposition-driven network"([https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07559](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0263224124009771))
## To Test
*pretrained weights can be found at here: [DeDNet](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Pu_f3XkrU3-dZZYvFmmfauyGwGWYZ__Z?usp=sharing), place the checkpoints under the corresponding floder

*Run "**CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python test.py**" to test the model.
